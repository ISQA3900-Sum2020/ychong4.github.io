## **Principles of Prompting**

### **Principle 1: Write clear and specific instructions**

**Tactic 1:** Use delimeters

```
    - Triple quotes: """
    - Triple backticks: ```
    - Triple dashes: ---
    - Angle brackets: <>
    - XML tags: <tag> </tag>
```

**Tactic 2:** Ask for structured output
HTML, JSON

**Tactic 3:** Check whether conditions are satisfied 
Check assumptions required to do the task

**Tactic 4:** Few-shot prompting
Give successful examples of completing task, then ask model to perform the task

### **Principle 2: Give the model time to think**

**Tactic 1:** Specify the steps to complete a task
    Step 1: ...
    Step 2: ...
    ...
    Step N: ...

**Tactic 2:** Instruct the model to work out its own solution before rushing to a conclusion


## **Model Limitations**

**Hallucination:** Makes statements that sound plausible but are not true

**Reducing hallucinations:** First find relevant information, then answer the question based on the relevant information
