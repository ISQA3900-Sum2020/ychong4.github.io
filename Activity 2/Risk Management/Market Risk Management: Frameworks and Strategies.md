## Financial Instruments

### 1. Bonds

**Bond Valuation**
- Bond valuation involves understanding the relationship between interest and discounting, and between interest rates and present values. To derive the intrinsic value of a bond you need to assess:
- (1) The size of expected cash flows from the bond.
- (2) The timing of expected cash flows.
- (3) The discount rate or required rate of return demanded by investors.
- Risk managers are especially interested in changes to bond prices given changes in interest rates.

**Discounting and Present Value**
- Bonds are fixed income securities because interest payments (called coupons) and principal payments are specified at issuance and remain fixed for the life of the bond.
- The yield to maturity (YTM) is the rate of return expected of an asset. It is used to calculate the net present value of future cash flows and compare this amount to the initial investment.
- The present value of a bond is a function of the present value of the expected coupon payments and the present value of the principal amount due at maturity.
- Bond price up when: yield down
- Bond price down when: yield up

**Macaulay Duration as a Measure of Risk**
- Duration measure the interest rate risk of a bond, by measuring sensitivity of a bond to a change in interest rates.
- High duration is high interest rate risk, low duration is low interest rate risk.
- Interest rate risk is higher for long-term bond, and lower for short-term bonds.
- Macaulay Duration equals the cash-flow weighted average time to maturity of a bond.

**Duration and % Change in Bond Prices**
- **Duration (D):** Represents the sensitivity of the bond rate of return to fluctuations in yield. It estimates the changes in the price of a bond or other debt instrument as interest rates go up or down.
- Longer duration bonds have a higher sensitivity to changes in yield.

**Modified Duration as a Measure of Risk**
- Modified Duration = (Macaulay Duration) / (1 + YTM)
- Modified duration identifies how much a bond's price changes for each percentage change in the yield.
- Modified duration can be used as a risk measure for bond investors as it approximates how much a bond price could decline with an increase in interest rates.

**Bond Modified Duration Using Excel**
- Duration measures the inverse relationship between the yield of a bond and its price (if interest rates rise then bond prices fall, and vice versa).
- Calculating duration requires bond price, yield to maturity, time to maturity and discounted future cash inflows from the bond.

**Types of Fixed-Income Securities**
-(1) **Fixed-Coupon Bonds:** Pay a fixed percentage of the principal every period and the principal as a one-time payment at maturity
-(2) **Zero-Coupon Bonds:** Pay no coupons, payment is principal only. The return is derived from purchasing at a discount to face value and receiving face value at maturity.
-(3) **Annuities:** Pay a constant amount over time, which includes interest and a gradual repayment of principal.
-(4) **Preceptual bonds:** Have no set redemption date and the value is derived from interest payments only.
-(5) **Floating-Coupon Bonds:** Pay interest equal to a reference rate plus a yield spread. The reference rate (usually LIBOR) resets on a regular basis.
-(6) **Structured Notes:** Have complex payment patterns based on investor need.
-(7) **Inflation-Protected Notes:** Pincipal is indexed to the Consumer Price Index.

**Risk Premiums-Yield Spreads**
- Yield spreads refer to the difference between a bond's yield and a similar maturity risk-free bond.
- Yield Spread = YTM(T , Risk Bond) - YTM(T , Government Bond)
- It constitutes the addtional return an investor gets for differences in: 
- (1) Quality or risk of default (this is the creidt spread)
- (2) Call features
- (3) Coupons
- (4) Marketability/Liquidity
- (5) Tax treatments

**Bond Strategies and Management: Passive**
- Passive management strategies are driven by the investor's belief that securities are fairly-priced in the sense that the expected return is commensurate with the risk taken.
- Passive investors do not actively seek out trading opportunities to try to outperform the market.

**Bond Strategies and Management: Active**
- Some investors look for price appreciation in addition to income potential, thus have more active management strategies.
- An investor could lengthen (shorten) the average maturity of a bond portfolio when they expect interest rates to devline (rise).
- Bond managers can also profit from expected changes in interest rates by using bond futures and interest rate swaps to adjust the duration of their portfolio.


### Equities
- Common stock represents ownership in a corporation
- Unlike bonds, equities have uncertain cash flows because dividends are at the discretion of the Board of Directors of a company
- This uncertainty makes equities more difficult to value than bonds
- Equities represent a residual claim because bonds and other creditors must be paid before equity if a company is to avoid default or bankruptcy.

**Common Stock Risks**
- (1) Market Risk: The chance of losses due to fluctuations in the stock market as a whole is referred to as market risk.
- (2) Interest Rate Risk: All securities, not just bonds are affected by interest rate movements. Interest rate risk affects common stocks because the market interest rate is a discount rate.
- (3) Business Risk: Involves the probability of a company suffering losses or profits less than expected because of adverse conditions.
- (4) Financial Risk: Also called leverage, involves the use of debt in financing the assets of a firm.
- (5) Systematic Risk: That part of the total variability directly associated with the variability of the overall market. Systematic risk cannot be reduced by diversification.
- (6) Un-Systematic Risk: That part of total risk not related to overall market variability. Attributable to the unique factors affecting a particular company. Un-systematic risk can be reduced by diversification. 

**Measures of Equity Risk**
- Threre are three main measures of Equity Risk:
- (1) Standard Deviation or Volatility
- (2) Beta which is also called Market Risk, Systematic Risk or Undiversifiable Risk
- (3) Value-at-Risk (VaR)

### Derivaties and Managing Market Risk
- Derivatives are traded in both the over-the-counter-marekt and on organized exchanges.
- They are private contracts whose value is derived from an underlying asset, reference rate or index.
- In contrast to securities, such as stocks and bonds, which are issued to raise capital, derivatives are private contracts between two parties. 

**Introduction to Derivatives: Counterparty Credit Risks**
- The derivatives market is huge
- The size of the derivatives market is also driven by their cost-effectiveness when used to manage risk
- A major issue with derivatives is countryparty risk, as the contract itself gives rise to credit risk
- Counterparty risk can also be managed by a clearinghouse, which is a financial institution that provides settlement and clearing services for financial transactions that take place either on an exchange or over-the-counter.

**Introduction to Derivatives: Clearinghouses**
- A clearinghouse reduces counterparty risk by acting as the counterparty to every buyer and seller.
- Clearinghouses reduce their countryparty risk in several ways:
- (1) They allow netting of transactions between counterparties.
- (2) They also have in place credit risk procedures that call for collateral deposits to be maintained and are adjusted at least daily.
- (3) Contracts are marked-to-market based on an independent evaluation of trades and if a member does not post additional collateral as required the clearinghouse has the right to liquidate the position.
- (4) Clearinghouses also rely on a guarantee fund provided by memebers that can be used to cover losses in case of default.

**Forward Contracts**
- Forward contracts are private agreements to exchange a given asset against cash or possibly another asset at a fixed futre point in time.
- The terms of the contract include quantity of units or shares, date, and price at the time of exchange.
- Forward contracts are contractual obligations because the exchange must take place, unless a default occurs.
- The value of a forward contract is determined by the relationship between the current spot price and the agreed forward price. For example, a wheat farmer could enter a forward contract to lock in the price now for delivery of wheat in the future, in thsi case the farmer is hedged against changes in prices.

**Swap Contracts**
- Swap contracts are over-the-counter agreements to exchange a series of cash flows according to specified terms.
- The underlying asset could be an interest rate, an exchange rate, an equity, a commodity or any index.
- Swaps tend to have longer maturities than forwards and futures.
- Swaps can be viewed as a sequential series of forward contracts.
- Swaps exist for Interest Rates, Commodities, Currencies, Debt - Equity, and Creidt Default Swaps.

**Fixed Rate Bond Investors: Pay Fixed Swap**
- Bond investors in the U.S. normally receive fixed-rate coupons
- Bond Fund Managers may want to protect their returns against increases in interest rates.
- Result: Fund manager has a synthetic floating rate exposure

**Futures Contracts Basic**
- A future contract is a commitment to buy or sell at a specified future settlement date a designated amount of a commodity.
- The seller (short) of the futures contract agrees to make delivery, and the buyer (long) of the contract agrees to take delivery at a currently detemrined market price.

**Financial Futures Market Pariticipants**
- Financial futures give investors more of an opportunity to fine-tune the risk and return characteristics of their portfolios.
- Participants in the future market have been classified as either hedgers or speculators:
- (1) Hedgers buy or sell futures contracts in order to offset the risk in a cash position. Hedgers must make timing decisions as to when to initiate and end the process, and, as conditions change, hedgers must adjust their hedge strategy.
- (2) Speculators buy or sell futures contracts in an attempt to earn a return. Speculators are willing to accept the risk of price fluctuations in order to profit from them.
