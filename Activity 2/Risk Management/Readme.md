## Risk
A deviation from expected value

## Risk Categories
**Known knowns:** (1) Well known (2) Identified and Measured <br>
**Known Unknowns:** Risks or information that you know about, but are uncertain as to when the risk will manifest itself <br>
**Unknown Unknowns:** Risks that are outside the scope of most scenarios because they are random events <br>

## Risk Identification & Risk Management Life Cycle
1. **Identify Known Risk:** Risks are things that if they manifest themselves could preclude a business from meeting its objectives. <br>
2. **Determine Probability & Impact:** Assess the likelihood of the risk manifesting itself & its potential impact. <br>
3. **Accept, Pursue or Avoid:** Management decides what risks to Accept, Pursue or Avoid <br>
4. **Risk Monitoring:** (1) Limits Thresholds Triggers, (2) Emerging & Strategic Risks <br>
5. **Event & Crisis Management:** (1) Some risks are unknowable, ex. Random Events (2) Establish protocols to manage Known and Unknown Risks <br>
6. **Root Cause Analysis:** Identify the root cause of a risk and its subsequent causal factors  <br>

## Market Risk
- Market Risk Management is the process of using market data and statistical emasures to identify, assess, measure, and manage risk to create economic value. <br>
- The goal is not to minimize risk, instead it is to take intelligent risks, based analysis of data. <br>
- Risk should be evaluated on a forward-looking basis. <br>

### Measure Market Risk
- Mean is the average return, and it is the mid-point of the curve. <br>
- Standard Deviation, also known as volatility, measures the dispersion around the mean, and the graph extend out to 4 standard deviations of gain/loss. <br>
- Value at Risk would be a percentile within the distribution. <br>
- Measure risk against a benchmark. (for comparison) <br>
- Absolute Risk is measure in terms of shortfall versus the initial value of the investment or the investment in cash. <br>
- Relative Risk is meaured versus a benchmark index. <br>
- Estimating the distribution of future profits and losses is a major part of the risk measurement process. <br>
- Future profit can be measured by calculating the return proportional to the investment. <br>
- Future losses is much harder to estimate given uncertainty. <br>

### Potfolio Construction
- Portfolio construction combines expected return and risk, and the choice of investment. <br>
- Risk and return is a tradeoff. Sharpe Ratio is the ratio of the average rate of return in excess of the risk-free rate to the absolute risk. <br>
- The **Sharpe Ratio** focuses on total risk measured in absolute terms. <br>
- Sharpe Ratio Formula = (Average Return on Portfolio - Risk-free rate of return)/Standard Deviation of the rate of return for Portfolio <br>
- Asset Allocation is the process of deciding how to construct a portfolio across all asset classes.  <br>
- **Correlation Coefficient** measures the extent to which two asset classes are related to each other.  <br>
- An Efficient Portfolio represents the portfolio mix that has the best risk and return characteristics. <br>

### Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)
- CAPM provides a formula that calculates the Expected Return of a security based on its risk and the Market Risk Premium (MRP) <br>
- E(Return) = Risk Free Rate + Beta x MRP <br>
- MRP = Market E(Return) - Risk Free Rate <br>
- Beta measures the risk arising from exposure to general market movements. The market itself has a beta of 1. <br>
- Alpha gauges the performance of an investment against a market index or benchmark that is considered to represent the market's movement-as-a-whole. <br>
- Calculating E(Return): A portfolio has an Expected Return of 8%, Volatility of 20%, and Beta of 0.5. The Risk-Free Rate is 5% and the Market Expected Return is 10%. What is the E(Return)? <br>
- E(R) = Risk-Free Rate + Beta x MRP <br>
- E(R) = 5% + 0.5 * (10% - 5%)  <br>
- E(R) = 7.5% <br>
