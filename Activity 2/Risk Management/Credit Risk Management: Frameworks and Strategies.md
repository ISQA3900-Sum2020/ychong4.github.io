## Credit Risk
- Credit exposure arising from the risk of non-payment and non-performance

### Three parties in Credit Analysis
- Lender, Investor
- Borrower, Issuer, Counterparty, Client
- Markets

### Workflow for risk decision
(1) Industry, business model, business environment + Risk analysis + Credit and financial analysis <br>
(2) Insight, judgment + Risk expereicnes, history, lessons learned <br>
(3) Overall risk assessment + Overall risk strategy <br>
(4) Risk decision <br>

### Risk Assessment: Strategy and Decision-Making
(1) Risk assessment <br>
- Financial analysis 
- Financial proposal <br>

(2) Risk strategy and outlook <br>
- Long-term exposure outlook
- Increase, maintain, decrease, withdraw <br>

(3) Risk decisions <br>
- Consistent with risk assessment
- Consistent with risk strategy
- Consistent with risk outlook <br>


### The argument and presentation will likely include the following and flow in the manner below:
- Industry, business model, business environment
- Risk analysis: Primary business risks, mitigants, financial impact, management response
- Management assessment (performance, growth, crisis response, operations efficiencies, succession, corporate culture, public reputation and brand)
- Financial analysis ("The financial story")
- Overall risk assessment, risk rating, risk outlook, risk strategy
- Financing needs, proposals, expected credit exposure, transaction structure
- Conclusions/recommendations, execution plans

</br>

## Credit and Financial Analysis
- **Assess creditworthiness:** The ability of the borrower (obligor) to make future contractual payments: interest payments and principal repayments
- Credit analysis will be used to assess and manage risks arising from many other activities, as well: countryparty trading, financial processing, cash-management activity, etc.
- **Establish the lender's (or creditor or debt investor's) position** for repayment vis a vis other lender (senior, junior, subordinated positions; secured, unsecured positions; short-term, long-term exposures)
- **Determine secondary sources** of repayment or other forms of recourse </br>
(1) Primary sources of payback </br>
(2) Secondary sources of payback </br>


### Corporate Balance Sheet
| Asset | Liability |
| ---- | ---- |
| Operating assets | Accrued Expenses |
|Fixed assets | Short-term debt |
| Intangible | Long-term debt |
| | Capital |


### Credit Analysis: Debt Purpose and Payback
- Tracking the purpose of the financing helps explain and highlight the primary source of repayment (e.g. cash from operations).
- The use and purpose of funds borrowed should be deployed to generate sources of payback: cash from revenues, related asset sales, etc.
- If the primary source declines or disappears, are there other sources? Is there a secondary source?

### Financial Analysis: Benefits and Deficiencies
**Benefits:** </br>
- Measures performance over time
- Measures financial condition at a point in time
- Detects trends that indicate or reinforce notions of strategy, business models, long-term growth
- Highlights vulnerabilities, worst-case scenarios, and company's "readiness" for downturns
- Provides ways to detect inconsistencies, flaws deceptions by management or possible fraud
- Used as starting point to project financial performance or the impact of worst-case scenarios
- Contribute substantially to risk ratings, strategy, and risk decisions

**Deficiencies:** </br>
- Presents an assessment based on past performance (old numbers)
- May overlook qualitative factors and current operating environment

### Goal
- Primary goal in credit analysis is to use information and insight to rate the following to: </br>
(1) Conclude on the company's financial condition </br>
(2) Assess whether the company can meet financial obligations. </br>

| Profitability | Management |
| --- | --- |
| Operating cash flows | Operations and controls |
| Asset quality, efficiency, productivity | Crisis preparation |
| Working capital | Market reputation | 
| Liquidity and cash reserves | Regulatory and compliance |
| Leverage, debt capacity | Overall financial condition |
| Capital structure| Outlook |
|Capital cushion and adequacy | |

</br>

### Credit Analysis: Ratings Mappings

| 5 | Adequate | BBB-, BB |
| 6 | | BB |

## Products and Exposures

### Credit Analysis: Exposures

**Categories of Exposure and Typical Financial Products**
- Loan Risk
- Contingent Risk
- Settlement Risk
- Pre-settlement Risk
- Issuer Risk

### Credit Analysis: Credit Exposures

**Degrees of Risk**
| Low | Medium | High |
| --  |   ---  |  --- |
| Intraday | Short Term | Long Term |
| Secured (Mkt Securities) | Secured (Fixed Assets) | Unsecured |
| Conditional Contingent | Uncommitted | Committed |
| Senior | Senior | Subordinated |

## Expected Loss

### Credit Risk Management: Expected Loss
- Financial institutions (banks, investors) manage risk by determining the "Expected Loss" for individual exposures and for an entire portfolio
- Expected loss is based, in part, on the credit rating derived from credit analysis
- Institutions and investors manage risks in the portfolio by analyzing trends in expected loss
- Banks use "Expected Loss" to detemrine loan-loss reserves
- Institutions and investors will also want to be compensated for risks based on "Expected Loss"

### Why "Expected Loss"?
- Portfolio management
- Basis for loan pricing and loan-loss reserves and charge-offs
- Credit risk management and risk decisions
- Industry risk management
- Risk capital allocation
- Regulatory-capital calculations: From Expected Loss to Unexpected Loss
- Reconcilliation with credit ratings, ratings assessments

## Understanding Defaults

### Credit Default
- Non-payment of principal or interest or other form of payment when due
- Non-payment after remedial, waiver, or cure period
- Non-payment after breach of financial covenant
- Non-performance (pledge of collateral, e.g.) as required by document
- Cross-default: Default applicable to separate third party lender/counterparty
- Exchange of debt: Exchange of one debt instrument for another with reduced value

### Credit Risk Management: Default Probability
- Probability of Default is based on Credit rating and Outlook Industry


### Credit Risk Management: Loss Given Default
- Loss Given Default = (1 - Recovery Rate)


## Risks vs Rewards

**Loan and  Debt Pricing**
- Base rate: (1) Cost of funding, (2) Risk-free rate
- Credit Spread: (1) Expected Loss = PD x LGD

## Debt Investors

### Credit Analysis: Debt Investors
- Debt investors include those who have made private-placement investments (notes) and those who have purchased public debt sucurities (bond, notes, debentures, convertible bonds, etc.).
- Debt investors seek to be paid interest and principal and want to protect themselves against default, while earning a return that compensate them for risks they endure.


## Assigning Ratings
- Investors and analysts will translate ratings-agency ratings into credit spreads to determine risk-based loan and bond pricing


| Rating | Default frequency | Default Probabiltiy |
| --  |   ---  |  --- |
| Fitch, S&P, Moody's | The rating and the tenor of the exposure can be mapped into an historical default frequency for that rating | The analyst can use the default frequency of that rating as a basis to derive probability of default for a defined tenor |
| | Based on past data, what percentage of debt outstanding in that ratings group defaulted over the defined tenor? | A credit spread accounts for "expected loss" or [Probability of default] x [Loss-given-default] |


## Understanding Default Trends

### Default Rates: Trends
**General trends: Global probability of default**
- Default rates, based on outstanding debt in selected years
- Using historical default rates to project "probability of default" going forward
- Determining "through the cycle" or "point in time" default rates
- Investment-grade names continue to perform as expected, deserving the ratings they earned.
- Non-investment trends show no discernible pattern yet.
- Overall default statistics may also reflect the declining performance of one or two significant, large borrowers.
- Statistics show ratings are fairly good predictors of probabilities of default.
- Defaults of AA-rated names occured in 1999 and 2008.
