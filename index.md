<h2>My story</h2>
<p>I am an International student from Malaysia. I was an undergraduate student majoring in Actuarial Sscience in UNL from 2015 - 2018. After that, I worked in Kingsbay Group, LLC for a year. Kingsbay Group is an E-commerce
 retailer. They mainly retail products on the Amazon Seller Portal. I worked as a Purchasing Analyst to predict the sales quantities of merchandize in the following seasons and purchase the amount from the manufacturers. I love the job because it is full of 
challenges. </p>

<h2>Current</h2>
<p>Currently, I am studying as a full-time student, Master's in MIS, and concentrate in data analytics. I started my journey in University of Nebraska-Omaha (UNO) from Spring 2020. The reason I choose MIS as major is that I am in love with using 
data to make decision. I believe data can tell the true story. </p>
