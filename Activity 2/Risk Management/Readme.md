## Risk
A deviation from expected value

## Risk Categories
**Known knowns:** (1) Well known (2) Identified and Measured <br>
**Known Unknowns:** Risks or information that you know about, but are uncertain as to when the risk will manifest itself <br>
**Unknown Unknowns:** Risks that are outside the scope of most scenarios because they are random events <br>

## Risk Identification & Risk Management Life Cycle
1. **Identify Known Risk:** Risks are things that if they manifest themselves could preclude a business from meeting its objectives. <br>
2. **Determine Probability & Impact:** Assess the likelihood of the risk manifesting itself & its potential impact. <br>
3. **Accept, Pursue or Avoid:** Management decides what risks to Accept, Pursue or Avoid <br>
4. **Risk Monitoring:** (1) Limits Thresholds Triggers, (2) Emerging & Strategic Risks <br>
5. **Event & Crisis Management:** (1) Some risks are unknowable, ex. Random Events (2) Establish protocols to manage Known and Unknown Risks <br>
6. **Root Cause Analysis:** Identify the root cause of a risk and its subsequent causal factors  <br>

## Market Risk
- Market Risk Management is the process of using market data and statistical emasures to identify, assess, measure, and manage risk to create economic value. <br>
- The goal is not to minimize risk, instead it is to take intelligent risks, based analysis of data. <br>
- Risk should be evaluated on a forward-looking basis. <br>

### Measure Market Risk
- Mean is the average return, and it is the mid-point of the curve. <br>
- Standard Deviation, also known as volatility, measures the dispersion around the mean, and the graph extend out to 4 standard deviations of gain/loss. <br>
- Value at Risk would be a percentile within the distribution. <br>
- Measure risk against a benchmark. (for comparison) <br>
- Absolute Risk is measure in terms of shortfall versus the initial value of the investment or the investment in cash. <br>
- Relative Risk is meaured versus a benchmark index. <br>
- Estimating the distribution of future profits and losses is a major part of the risk measurement process. <br>
- Future profit can be measured by calculating the return proportional to the investment. <br>
- Future losses is much harder to estimate given uncertainty. <br>

### Potfolio Construction
- Portfolio construction combines expected return and risk, and the choice of investment. <br>
- Risk and return is a tradeoff. Sharpe Ratio is the ratio of the average rate of return in excess of the risk-free rate to the absolute risk. <br>
- The **Sharpe Ratio** focuses on total risk measured in absolute terms. <br>
- Sharpe Ratio Formula = (Average Return on Portfolio - Risk-free rate of return)/Standard Deviation of the rate of return for Portfolio <br>
- Asset Allocation is the process of deciding how to construct a portfolio across all asset classes.  <br>
- **Correlation Coefficient** measures the extent to which two asset classes are related to each other.  <br>
- An Efficient Portfolio represents the portfolio mix that has the best risk and return characteristics. <br>

### Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)
- CAPM provides a formula that calculates the Expected Return of a security based on its risk and the Market Risk Premium (MRP) <br>
- E(Return) = Risk Free Rate + Beta x MRP <br>
- MRP = Market E(Return) - Risk Free Rate <br>
- Beta measures the risk arising from exposure to general market movements. The market itself has a beta of 1. <br>
- Alpha gauges the performance of an investment against a market index or benchmark that is considered to represent the market's movement-as-a-whole. <br>
- Calculating E(Return): A portfolio has an Expected Return of 8%, Volatility of 20%, and Beta of 0.5. The Risk-Free Rate is 5% and the Market Expected Return is 10%. What is the E(Return)? <br>
- E(R) = Risk-Free Rate + Beta x MRP <br>
- E(R) = 5% + 0.5 * (10% - 5%)  <br>
- E(R) = 7.5% <br>

## Credit Risk
- Credit Risk is measured by the cost of replacing cash flows if the counterparty or obligor (borrower) defaults. <br>
- Credit Risk and Market Risk have in many ways converged because of the introduction of new products (securitized products like mortgage-backed securities, credit default swaps) <br>
- However, credit still requires constructing the distribution of Default Probabilities, Loss Given Default, and of Credit Exposures, all of which contribute to credit losses and should be measured in a portfolio context. <br>
- Pre-Settlement Risk is the risk of loss due to a counterparty's failure to perform on an obligation during the life of the transaction. Pre-settlement Risk exists for long time periods as it is the life of the transaction from start to settlement. <br>
- Settlement Risk asrises from the exchange of cash flows and is short-term in comparison. The risk is due to the timing of cash outflow versus inflow and the risk heightens especially due to different time zones.
- Failure to honor payments can be from default, liquidity constraints or operational issues. <br>
- Real-time gross settlement systems strive to reduce the time interval between the time an institution can no longer stop a payment and the receipt of the funds from the counterparty. <br>
- Settle Risk can also be amanged by netting agreements. <br>
- Bilateral netting is when two banks settle based on the net balance outstanding rather than the notional balance. <br>
- Multilateral netting system (also called continuous-linked settlements) are when payments are netted for a group of banks that belong to the system). <br>

### Credit-Risk Components
- **Probability of Default (PD):** The probability of default needs to be estimated
- **Credit Exposure:** The economic claim on the countrparty and also called Exposure At Default (EAD).
- **Loss Given Default (LGD):** The fractional loss due to a default.
- **Maturity:** The effective reamining term of a credit facility.

### Overview of the Credit Risk
- Expected Loss is the sum of the values of all probable losses, with each multiplied by the probability of that loss occuring. For bank loans, expected loss is shown as the Loan Loss Reserve on the balance sheet.
- Unexpected Loss is the loss over and above Expected Loss. It is calculated as a number of standard deviations from the mean at a certain confidence interval. Also referred to as Credit Value at Risk.
- The extension of credit has an embedded short option position because the borrow has the option to default. This embedded option causes lower credit quality borrowers to have higher interest rates.
- Expected Loss (EL) = PD x LGV x Exposure at Default
- Exposure at Default is the total value a bank is exposed to when a loan defaults.
- Economic Capital is the amount of capital, assessed on a risk-adjusted basis, that a firm needs to ensure solvency in a worst-case scenario.
