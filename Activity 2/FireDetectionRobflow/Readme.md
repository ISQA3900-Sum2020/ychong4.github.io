<h1>Fire Detection Projection using Roboflow</h1>

<p>URL: https://app.roboflow.com/chong-yaow-hui-henfg/fire-detection-wfdhl/1</p>

<p>**Goal:** The goal of this project is to build a fire detector using Yolov8 algorithm on Roboflow. </p>
<p>**Background:** Yolov8 is a state-of-the-art YOLO Model developed by Ultralytics, which is specialized in computer vision tasks such as real-time object detection, classification, and segmentation. Compared to the previous generations of YOLO Models, Yolov8 is faster, more accurate, and simpler. Fore more details, please read: https://ultralytics.com/yolov8 </p>

<p>**Dataset:** There are total of 3,284 fire images, which are then split into 2,628 training images, 328 validation images, and 328 test images.</p>

<p>**Preprocessing:** All images are resized to 640x 640. </p>

<p>**Data Augmentation:** Data Augmentation techniques are applied to increasing training accuracy. The applied techniques are (1) Horizontal flip, (2) 0-12% Random Crop, and (3) -10° to +10° Random Rotation. </p>
