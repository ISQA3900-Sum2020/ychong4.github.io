<h1>Fire Detection Projection using Roboflow</h1>

<p>URL: https://app.roboflow.com/chong-yaow-hui-henfg/fire-detection-wfdhl/1</p>

<p>Goal: The goal of this project is to build a fire detector using Yolov8 algorithm on Roboflow. </p>
<p>Background: Yolov8 is a state-of-the-art YOLO Model developed by Ultralytics, which is specialized in computer vision tasks such as real-time object detection, classification, and segmentation. Compared to the previous generations of YOLO Models, Yolov8 is faster, more accurate, and simpler. Fore more details, please read: https://ultralytics.com/yolov8 </p>
