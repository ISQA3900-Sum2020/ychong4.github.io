### Risk: A deviation from expected value


**Known knowns:** (1) Well known (2) Identified and Measured <br>
**Known Unknowns:** Risks or information that you know about, but are uncertain as to when the risk will manifest itself <br>
**Unknown Unknowns:** Risks that are outside the scope of most scenarios because they are random events <br>

## Risk Identification & Risk Management Life Cycle
1. **Identify Known Risk:** Risks are things that if they manifest themselves could preclude a business from meeting its objectives. <br>
2. **Determine Probability & Impact:** Assess the likelihood of the risk manifesting itself & its potential impact. <br>
3. **Accept, Pursue or Avoid:** Management decides what risks to Accept, Pursue or Avoid <br>
4. **Risk Monitoring:** (1) Limits Thresholds Triggers, (2) Emerging & Strategic Risks <br>
5. **Event & Crisis Management:** (1) Some risks are unknowable, ex. Random Events (2) Establish protocols to manage Known and Unknown Risks <br>
6. **Root Cause Analysis:** Identify the root cause of a risk and its subsequent causal factors  <br>
