## Credit and Financial Analysis
- **Assess creditworthiness:** The ability of the borrower (obligor) to make future contractual payments: interest payments and principal repayments
- Credit analysis will be used to assess and manage risks arising from many other activities, as well: countryparty trading, financial processing, cash-management activity, etc.
- **Establish the lender's (or creditor or debt investor's) position** for repayment vis a vis other lender (senior, junior, subordinated positions; secured, unsecured positions; short-term, long-term exposures)
- **Determine secondary sources** of repayment or other forms of recourse </br>
(1) Primary sources of payback </br>
(2) Secondary sources of payback </br>


### Corporate Balance Sheet
| Asset | Liability |
| ---- | ---- |
| Operating assets | Accrued Expenses |
|Fixed assets | Short-term debt |
| Intangible | Long-term debt |
| | Capital |


### Credit Analysis: Debt Purpose and Payback
- Tracking the purpose of the financing helps explain and highlight the primary source of repayment (e.g. cash from operations).
- The use and purpose of funds borrowed should be deployed to generate sources of payback: cash from revenues, related asset sales, etc.
- If the primary source declines or disappears, are there other sources? Is there a secondary source?

### Financial Analysis: Benefits and Deficiencies
**Benefits:** </br>
- Measures performance over time
- Measures financial condition at a point in time
- Detects trends that indicate or reinforce notions of strategy, business models, long-term growth
- Highlights vulnerabilities, worst-case scenarios, and company's "readiness" for downturns
- Provides ways to detect inconsistencies, flaws deceptions by management or possible fraud
- Used as starting point to project financial performance or the impact of worst-case scenarios
- Contribute substantially to risk ratings, strategy, and risk decisions

**Deficiencies:** </br>
- Presents an assessment based on past performance (old numbers)
- May overlook qualitative factors and current operating environment

### Goal

(1) Conclude on the company's financial condition </br>
(2) Assess whether the company can meet financial obligations. </br>
