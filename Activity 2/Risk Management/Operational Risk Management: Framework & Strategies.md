## What is Operational Risk and How is it Managed?

**Operational Risk for Financial Institutions**
- Operational risk is instrinsic to financial institutions and poses a significant threat to their financial solvency.
- Developments in information systems and computing technology have facilitated improvements in the measurement and management of operational risk.
- The same technological advancements that are reshaping today's business environment are also likely expose financial institutions to even greater operational risks in the future.
- Financial institutions and regulators must continue to strengthen their approach to managing and mitigating operational risk.

**Three-Lines of Defense Risk Management**
- **First line of defense:** Functions that own and manage risk
- **Second line of defense:** Functions that oversee or specialize in risk management, compliance
- **Third line of defense:** Functions that provide independent assurance, above all internal audit

**Definitions of Operational Risk**
**Narrow (Basel II, BCBS*)**
Risk of losses resulting from:
- Inadequate or failed internal processes,
- people and 
- systems or
- from external events
- Including: legal risk (as fraud constitudes the most significant Op Risk loss events category and a legal issue,
- Excluding strategic & reputational risks

**Wide**
BCBS definition is artificial, primarily for regulatory capital calculation.
- The largest Op Risk component - Business risk - OMITTED
- Reputational risk (biggestbiz risk!) - EXCLUDED
- All risks, other than credit and market, which could cause volatility of revenues, expenses, and value of the bank's business.

**Reputation Risk is an Op Risk**
- Reputation is a key asset of a financial institution, as it represents its past and future prospects, describe its attractiveness for the stakeholders as compared to competitors
- Risk Quantification is difficult.
- 3 Elements of Rep Risk Management:
- (1) Crisis management (acute risks management) - based on catastrophic Op Riks management
- (2) Risk management (latent reputational challenges)
- (3) Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)

**Operational Risk is Enterprise-wide**
- Operational Risk Management allows us to look across the Enterprise in a holistic manner to create a detailed Risk Profile that business-line managers and senior management can use to better run their businesses.

**Types of Operational Risk**
Risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events.
- Process Risks - Execution, Delivery, Process Management, Business Disruption, Systems Failure
- Conduct Risks - Clients, Products, Business Practices, Employment Practices, Internal Theft, Fraud
- External Risks - External Theft and Fraud, Damage to Physical Assets

**Sources of Operational Risks**
- Business Practices: Inappropriate business safeguarding of customer or proprietary information assets; cyber-security
- Continuity of Business: Inability to continue business during a contingency event
- Employment Practices: Inappropriate employment practices and workplace environment
- Vendor Management: Risks not eliminated, poor practices

## Operational Risk as a discipline
| | History | Risk Measurement | Risk Mitigation Tools |
| -- | -- | -- | --|
| Credit Risk | Age > 60 yrs, Portfolio view > 45 yrs, Quantitative > 30 yrs, Active mitigation > 25 yrs | Value at Risk based on: (1) Prob. of Default - ORR (Obligor Risk Rating), (2) LGD - FRR (Facility - Risk Rating) | Target market/portfolio; Risk-based capital; Credit approval process; Assignments/syndicates; Credit derivatives |
| Market Risk | Age > 40 yrs, Portfolio view > 30 yrs, Quantitative > 25 yrs, Active mitigation > 20 yrs | Value at Risk based on: (1) Factor Sensitivity, (2) Potential Losses | Risk-based capital; Boundaries; Diversification Hedging positions |
| Operational Risk | Age < 15 yrs, Portfolio view... TBD, Quantitative < 10 yrs, Active mitigation culture? | Value at Risk based on: (1) Loss frequency, (2) Loss severity, (3) Metrics / Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) | Risk-based capital tied to pace of business growth; Infrastructure investment, planning people management and training

**Operational Risk Management Objectives**
- Manage the frequency and severity of events and losses
- Scale operational risk exposure (quantitative, qualitative) to conform to an acceptable level of risk
- Ensure adequate controls to maintain exposure and financial/reputation risk within acceptable levels
- Determine the appropriate level of capital to absorb extreme losses associated with risks that are difficult to control or where the control mechanism fails.

**Operational Risk Management Tools**
The Tools of Operational Risk Management:
- Loss capture for causal analysis (to get preventive measures), capital modeling
- Assessments (Self, Audit, Regulator) for view on control effectiveness), residual risk
- Metrics (KRI) warn of imbalances and serve to attract management attention
- Scenario analysis dimensions potential frequency and severity, unexpected losses
- Capital aids the firm's solvency; capital allocation informs management decisions

**Operational Risk Measurement Challenges**
- Potential losses are practically unbounded 
- Exposure is undefined and undimensioned 
- Losses are not capped, e.g. by Credit Risk Limits or Market Risk Stop Losses
- Observed loss amounts are not simplt related to firm size although some evidence of deep pockets premium e.g. lawsuits and regulatory settlements.
- Loss severity distributions are fat-tailed.
- Capital need is driven by the risk of infrequent but extremely large events

**Op Risk Management Equation**
| Inherent Risk | - | Mitigation or 'Hedge' | = | Residual Risk | < or = | Risk Appetite |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Identified & Classified | | Controls, Designed & Implemented | | Informed by Losses, Metrics, Scenarios | | Top-Down Quantitative & Qualitative |
| Basel with bespoke, Adjustments | | Assess & Test Design AND Effectivness | | Assessed and Independently Tested | | Re-tested against Scenarios, Capital |
| Jointly determined - Business & Risk | | Primary role of Business Management | | Primary role of Operation Risk Management | | Board, Senior Management, Risk Management


**The Cost-Benefit Proposition in Op Risk**
- Process-focus and optimization, integrated with Business Objectives
- Entire Approach oriented towards Risk with respect to Appetite
- Forward-looking view of Severity, Frequency, Onset
- Inform about Cost-Benefit-Risk Tradeoffs and Pricing
- Provide key inputs for investment decisions and governance 
- Design Capital program as a dynamic tool to measure and manage
- Provide the basis for clear actions with respect to: (1) Business Strategy, (2) Business Process, (3) Remediation priorities across business lines

## Risk and Control Self-Assessment (RCSA)
- RSCA is a critical component for risk management framework

**Main Operational Risk Management Tools**
(1) **Risk and Control Self-Assessment**
- Interviews, surveys
- Qualitative assessment
- Risk mapping
- Priorities setup

(2) **Loss event Database**
- Standardized Registration
- Centralized storage
- RCSA approval
- Quantitative assessment

(3) **Scenario Modeling & Analysis**
- Process descriptions
- Weaknesses search
- Op Risk testing
- Analysis (KRI, limits)
- Re-engineering

(4) **Key Risk Indicators**
- Risk monitoring
- Trend analysis
- Comparisons
- Reasoning
- Proactive management

**RCSA: Proactive Risk Identification & Management Tool
- Business lines & support functions assess controls in their area;
- RCSA provides systematic means to identify: (1) Risk clusters (concentrations), (2) Control duplications/gaps or over-controls
- and to set up: (1) prevention & control measures and (2) corrective action plans
- Was originally an Internal Audit tool, facilitates a risk-focused approach to Internal Audit;
- RCSA proactive as opposed to Op Loss Reporting
- Allocates front line responsibility for ORM directly with management -> corrective actions are more effective & timelier.

**RCSA Objectives**
- **Identify** Op Risks
- **Asess** and quantify the institution's exposure to Op Risks
- **Evaluate** the prevention & control system
- **Mitigate** the risks

**Risk and Control Self-Assessment WORKFLOW**
- (1) Define the implementation mode / Document the process
- (2) Identify & Assess Op Risks (including risk scoring)
- (3) Identify Controls (Preventative & Detective)
- (4) Assess & rate the controls (exante & ex-post)
- (5) Controls improper or are Non-existent
- (6) Update KRIs, adjust scenario analysis, enhance controls & training 
- (7) Follow-up on Implementation
- (8) Report Results/Analyze Residual Risks

**Management Results Reporting Tools**
- Unless RCSA results are relevant for management decision making, the exercise is no more than an expensive awareness tool
- Management Reporting through dashboards / heat maps / scorecards

**Heat Mapping**
- Facilitates the assessment of the likelihood and impact of the risk materializing; Can aslo be used to help determining the "top" risks
- E.g. Frequency-Severity Matrix, Frequency-Severity-Control Matrix

**RCSA Follow Up**
- RCSA results ought to be used in conjunction with other components of ORM Framework.
- **Internal Event Data:** (1) Highlight areas susceptible to Op Risk loss events, (2) Reassures quality of RCSA
- **External loss data:** (1) RCSA identifies areas of vulnerability that may benefit from considering fas-track external data, (2) Data helps determining potential weaknesses / inherent risks for RCSA
- **Scenario analysis:** (1) RCSA results serve a valuable input source; (2) Defining risk scenarios leads to identifying risk factors failed to be captured within RCSA.
