## Section 1: Introduction
### Two types of large language models (LLMs)

1) **Base LLM:** Predicts next word, based on text training data

</br>

   Example:

    Input: Once upon a time, there was a unicorn

    Output: that lived in a magical forest with all her unicorn friends

</br>

2) **Instruction Tuned LLM:** Tries to follow instructions, fine-tune on instructions and good attempts at following those instructions.

RLHF: Reinforcement learning with Human Feedback 

</br>

  Example:

     Input: What is the capital of France?

     Output: The capital of France is Paris
     
     
### To install chatGPT

      !pip install openai
      

## Section 2: Guidelines

### Two Principles of Prompting

</br>

#### Principle 1: Write clear and specific instructions

**Tactic 1:** Use delimeters

```
    Triple quotes: """
    Triple backticks: ```
    Triple dashes: ---
    Angle brackets: <>
    XML tags: <tag> </tag>
```

**Tactic 2:** Ask for structured output

```
HTML, JSON
```

**Tactic 3:** Check whether conditions are satisfied 

```
Check assumptions required to do the task
```


**Tactic 4:** Few-shot prompting

```
Give successful examples of completing task, then ask model to perform the task
```

</br>

#### **Principle 2: Give the model time to think**

**Tactic 1:** Specify the steps to complete a task

```
    Step 1: ...
    Step 2: ...
    ...
    Step N: ...
```

**Tactic 2:** Instruct the model to work out its own solution before rushing to a conclusion

</br>

### Model Limitations

</br>

**Hallucination:** Makes statements that sound plausible but are not true

**Reducing hallucinations:** First find relevant information, then answer the question based on the relevant information


</br>


## Section 3: Iterative

### Iterative Prompt Development

**Prompt Guidelines:**
```
- Be clear and specific
- Analyze why result does not give desired output.
- Refine the idea and the prompt.
- Repeat.
```
</br>

**Iterative Process:**
```
- Try something.
- Analyze where the result does not give you what you want.
- Clarify instructions, give more time to think.
- Refine prompts with a batch of examples.
```



## Section 4: Summarizing



## Section 5: Inferring


## Section 6: Transforming

ChatGPT is trained with sources in many languages. It can be used for Translation, Tone Transformation, Format Conversion, and Spellcheck/Grammar check.

</br>
### Translation 

```
prompt = f"""
Translate the following  text to French and Spanish
and English pirate: \
```I want to order a basketball```
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```
Output:
```
French pirate: ```Je veux commander un ballon de basket```
Spanish pirate: ```Quiero pedir una pelota de baloncesto```
English pirate: ```I want to order a basketball```
```

</br>
### Tone Transformation

```
prompt = f"""
Translate the following from slang to a business letter: 
'Dude, This is Joe, check out this spec on this standing lamp.'
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```
Output:
```
Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to bring to your attention a standing lamp that I believe may be of interest to you. Please find attached the specifications for your review.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Joe
```

</br>
### Format Conversion

```
data_json = { "resturant employees" :[ 
    {"name":"Shyam", "email":"shyamjaiswal@gmail.com"},
    {"name":"Bob", "email":"bob32@gmail.com"},
    {"name":"Jai", "email":"jai87@gmail.com"}
]}

prompt = f"""
Translate the following python dictionary from JSON to an HTML \
table with column headers and title: {data_json}
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```
Output:
```
<table>
  <caption>Restaurant Employees</caption>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Email</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Shyam</td>
      <td>shyamjaiswal@gmail.com</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Bob</td>
      <td>bob32@gmail.com</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Jai</td>
      <td>jai87@gmail.com</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

</br>
### Spellcheck/Grammar Check
```
text = f"""
Got this for my daughter for her birthday cuz she keeps taking \
mine from my room.  Yes, adults also like pandas too.  She takes \
it everywhere with her, and it's super soft and cute.  One of the \
ears is a bit lower than the other, and I don't think that was \
designed to be asymmetrical. It's a bit small for what I paid for it \
though. I think there might be other options that are bigger for \
the same price.  It arrived a day earlier than expected, so I got \
to play with it myself before I gave it to my daughter.
"""
prompt = f"proofread and correct this review: ```{text}```"
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```
Output:
```
I got this for my daughter's birthday because she keeps taking mine from my room. Yes, adults also like pandas too. She takes it everywhere with her, and it's super soft and cute. However, one of the ears is a bit lower than the other, and I don't think that was designed to be asymmetrical. Additionally, it's a bit small for what I paid for it. I think there might be other options that are bigger for the same price. On the positive side, it arrived a day earlier than expected, so I got to play with it myself before I gave it to my daughter.
```



## Section 7: Expanding

ChatGPT can be used to generate customer service emails that are tailored to each customer's review.

```
# given the sentiment from the lesson on "inferring",
# and the original customer message, customize the email
sentiment = "negative"

# review for a blender
review = f"""
So, they still had the 17 piece system on seasonal \
sale for around $49 in the month of November, about \
half off, but for some reason (call it price gouging) \
around the second week of December the prices all went \
up to about anywhere from between $70-$89 for the same \
system. And the 11 piece system went up around $10 or \
so in price also from the earlier sale price of $29. \
So it looks okay, but if you look at the base, the part \
where the blade locks into place doesnâ€™t look as good \
as in previous editions from a few years ago, but I \
plan to be very gentle with it (example, I crush \
very hard items like beans, ice, rice, etc. in the \ 
blender first then pulverize them in the serving size \
I want in the blender then switch to the whipping \
blade for a finer flour, and use the cross cutting blade \
first when making smoothies, then use the flat blade \
if I need them finer/less pulpy). Special tip when making \
smoothies, finely cut and freeze the fruits and \
vegetables (if using spinach-lightly stew soften the \ 
spinach then freeze until ready for use-and if making \
sorbet, use a small to medium sized food processor) \ 
that you plan to use that way you can avoid adding so \
much ice if at all-when making your smoothie. \
After about a year, the motor was making a funny noise. \
I called customer service but the warranty expired \
already, so I had to buy another one. FYI: The overall \
quality has gone done in these types of products, so \
they are kind of counting on brand recognition and \
consumer loyalty to maintain sales. Got it in about \
two days.

## Section 8: Chatbot

Three roles in the messages
```
1. System: Sets behavior of assistant
2. Assistant: Chat model
3. User: You
```

### Chatbot

Example:
```
messages =  [  
{'role':'system', 'content':'You are friendly chatbot.'},    
{'role':'user', 'content':'Hi, my name is Isa'}  ]
response = get_completion_from_messages(messages, temperature=1)
print(response)
```
Output: Hi Isa! How can I assist you today?

</br>

Example:
```
messages =  [  
{'role':'system', 'content':'You are friendly chatbot.'},
{'role':'user', 'content':'Hi, my name is Isa'},
{'role':'assistant', 'content': "Hi Isa! It's nice to meet you. \
Is there anything I can help you with today?"},
{'role':'user', 'content':'Yes, you can remind me, What is my name?'}  ]
response = get_completion_from_messages(messages, temperature=1)
print(response)
```
Output: Of course, your name is Isa!

</br>

### Orderbot

Automate the collection of user prompt and assistant responses to build a OrderBot.

![](orderbot.png)

Summarize the order as a json format and input to the system

```
{
  "pizza": [
    {
      "type": "pepperoni",
      "size": "large",
      "price": 12.95
    },
    {
      "type": "cheese",
      "size": "medium",
      "price": 9.25
    }
  ],
  "toppings": [
    {
      "type": "extra cheese",
      "price": 2.00
    },
    {
      "type": "mushrooms",
      "price": 1.50
    }
  ],
  "drinks": [
    {
      "type": "coke",
      "size": "large",
      "price": 3.00
    },
